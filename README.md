## Introduction

The **Ticketing Software** is a web-based application designed to allow users to purchase tickets for events and receive digital tickets with QR codes. The system also includes a validation feature for event organizers to ensure the authenticity of purchased tickets.

This project follows a modular structure, separating the frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and backend logic, making it easy to extend and maintain.

---

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for purchasing tickets.
- **Digital Tickets**: Automatically generates a unique QR code for each ticket upon purchase.
- **Ticket Validation**: Allows event organizers to validate tickets by scanning or entering the ticket code.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures usability on all devices, including mobile and desktop.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed with modularity in mind, allowing easy integration with databases and APIs.
